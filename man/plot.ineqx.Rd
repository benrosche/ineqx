\bold{Interpretation of the y-axis}

The interpretation of \code{yint=1} (default) is in absolute points of CV2\{W/B/T\}.

The interpretation of \code{yint=2}
\itemize{
  \item For \code{plot(ineqx.out, type="dBP")} or \code{plot(ineqx.out, type="dBT")}, it is the change in the proportion of dB/CV2B, dP/CV2B relative to the reference value given in \code{ref}. The interpretation of \code{dB} is analogous.
  \item For \code{plot(ineqx.out, type="dT")}, it is the change in the proportion of dW/CV2T, dB/CV2T, dP/CV2T, dT/CV2T relative to the reference value given in ref.
  }
In the example, the CV2 is used as inequality statistic. But the interpretation for the variance as inequality statistic is analogous.
