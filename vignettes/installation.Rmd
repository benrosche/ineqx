### Installation consists of two steps:

1. Install devtools if necessary: ```install.packages("devtools")```
2. Install ineqx: ```devtools::install_github("benrosche/ineqx")```



### Notes:

- The library is still in development. Several features are not yet working. Please contact me if you have any questions or need support with implementation.
- In some cases, dependencies must be installed or are updated before `ineqx` can be installed. 
- If you get ```Error: (converted from warning) ...```, you can set ```Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")```
