### 1 Descriptive variance decomposition

Take the vector $Y_t$ to be individual incomes at time $t$, and the vector $G_t$ to be the group to which the individuals belong, where $G_t=j$ is a categorical variable with $j=1,â€¦,J$ categories that represent mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups. The variance $V$ in income at time $t$ can then be expressed as the sum of the variance within and between groups: 

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split} 
V_t(Y_t) 
&= E(V(Y_t |G_t))+V(E(Y_t |G_t )) \\[10pt] 
&= W_t + B_t \\[10pt]
&= \sum_j\pi_{jt}\sigma_{jt}^2+\sum_j\pi_{jt}\big(\mu_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt}\mu_{jt}\big)^2
\end{split}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}

where $\pi_{jt}$ is the proportion of individuals in group $j$ at time $t$, $\mu_{jt}$ is the mean income in group $j$ at time $t$, and $\sigma_{jt}^2$ is the variance around this mean in group $j$ at time $t$.

With repeated cross-sectional or panel data, the change in variance from $t_0$ (baseline) to $t$ (any timepoint post baseline) can then be decomposed into the sum of a within-group effect ($\delta_W$), a between-group effect ($\delta_B$), and a compositional effect ($\delta_C$). That is,
\begin{equation} 
V_t-V_{t_0} = \delta_W^t + \delta_B^t + \delta_C^t \\[10pt]
\text{where} \\[10pt]
\begin{split}
\delta_W^t &= \sum_j \pi_{jt_0} \big( \sigma_{jt}^2 - \sigma_{jt_0}^2 \big) \\[10pt]
\delta_B^t &= \sum_j \pi_{jt_0} \big( (\mu_{jt} - \sum_j\pi_{jt}\mu_{jt})^2 - (\mu_{jt_0} - \sum_j\pi_{jt_0}\mu_{jt_0})^2 \big) \\[10pt]
\delta_C^t &= \sum_j \big( \pi_{jt}-\pi_{jt_0} \big) \big( (\mu_{jt} - \sum_j\pi_{jt}\mu_{jt})^2 + \sigma_{jt}^2 \big) 
\end{split}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}

The between-group effect ($\delta_B^t$) captures the change in total variance induced by changes in the mean of each group. The within-group effect ($\delta_W^t$) captures the change in total variance induced by changes in the variance around the mean of each group. Finally, the compositional effect ($\delta_C^t$) captures the change in total variance induced by changes in the relative size of each group. The superscript $t$ on the $\delta\text{s}$ indicates that the change over time is considered. 

### 2 Causal variance decomposition

I first entertain the treatment effect framework at a single point in time. Let $D\in\{0,1\}$ be a binary treatment, $Y(D)$ be the potential outcome of the same outcome vector as before, and $\tau=Y(1)-Y(0)$ be the intra-individual causal effect of treatment on the outcome. 

The group-specific treatment effect on the mean of the treated ($ATT$) then equals the expected value of the differences in the potential outcomes in each group: 

\begin{equation} 
ATT_j=E[Y(1)-Y(0)|G=j,D=1]
\tag{3}
\end{equation}

Further, the group-specific treatment effect on the variance of the treated ($VTT$) equals the expected value of the difference in the variance in the potential outcomes in each group:

\begin{equation} 
VTT_j=E[V[Y(1)|G=j,D=1]-V[Y(0)|G=j,D=1]]
\tag{4}
\end{equation}

#### 2a Decomposing the effect of treatment

The focus here is on the $ATT$ rather than the average treatment effect ($ATE$) as we are interested in the aggregate consequences of treatment, which depends on the actual distribution of treatment across groups, $E[D|G]$, and therefore on the $ATT$. Note that we assume that the treatment effect on the variance is fully described by its effect on the group-specific means and variances.
Given these definitions, the effect of treatment on the variance can be decomposed into a within- and between group component, where the variance in the $ATT$ equals the between-group component and the expected value of the $VTT$ equals the within-group component:

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
V[Y(1)|D]-V[Y(0)|D] &= V[ATT]+E[VTT] \\[10pt]
&= \delta_B^D + \delta_W^D \\[10pt]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\text{where} \\[10pt]
\begin{split}
\delta_B^D &= \sum_j \pi_j \big( (\mu_j+\beta_j- \sum_j\pi_j(\mu_j+\beta_j))^2 - (\mu_j - \sum_j\pi_j\mu_j)^2 \big) \\[10pt]
\delta_W^D &= \sum_j \pi_j \big( (\sigma_j+\lambda_j )^2 - \sum_j\pi_j\sigma_j^2 \big)
\end{split}
\tag{5}
\end{equation}

Note that the interpretation of some quantities changes as compared to equation (2). In equation (5), $\pi_j$ is the proportion of individuals in each group receiving treatment (i.e., $E[D|G]$), $\mu_j$ is the pre-treatment mean in group $j$, $\sigma_j$ is the pre-treatment standard deviation in group $j$, $\beta_j$ is the causal effect of treatment on $\mu_j$, $\lambda_j$ is the causal effect of treatment on $\sigma_j$. The superscript $D$ on the $\delta\text{s}$ indicates that the change caused by treatment (at a single point in time) is considered. 
The between-group effect $\delta_B^D$ captures the change in total variance induced by the effect of treatment on the mean of each group. The within-group effect $\delta_W^D$ captures the change in total variance induced by the effect of treatment on the variance of each group.

#### 2b Decomposing the change in the effect of treatment

The treatment effect on the variance depends both on the treatment effects on the group-specific means and variances and on the distribution of treatment across groups and on the level of pre-treatment inequality. Therefore, with repeated cross-sectional or panel data, the change in total variance from $t_0$ (baseline) to $t$ (any timepoint post baseline) due to change in the effect of treatment can be decomposed into the sum of a between-group effect ($\delta_B^{D,t}$), within-group effect ($\delta_W^{D,t}$) a compositional effect ($\delta_C^{D,t}$), and a pre-treatment effect ($\delta_P^{D,t}$):

\begin{equation}
(V[Y_t(1)|D_t]-V[Y_t(0)|D_t]) - (V[Y_{t_0}(1)|D_{t_0}]-V[Y_{t_0}(0)|D_{t_0}])
= \delta_B^{D,t} + \delta_W^{D,t} + \delta_C^{D,t} + \delta_P^{D,t} \\[10pt]
\text{where} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}

\delta_B^{D,t} 
&= B(\pi_{t_0},\mu_{t_0}+\beta_t) - B(\pi_{t_0},\mu_{t_0}+\beta_0) \\
&= \sum_j\pi_{j,t_0} \left( \Big(\mu_{j,t_0} + \beta_{j,t} - \sum_j\pi_{j,t_0}(\mu_{j,t_0}+\beta_{j,t}) \Big)^2 - \Big(\mu_{j,t_0} + \beta_{j,t_0} - \sum_j\pi_{j,t_0}(\mu_{j,t_0}+\beta_{j,t_0} ) \Big)^2 \right) \\[10pt]
        
\delta_W^{D,t}
&= W(\pi_{t_0},\sigma_{t_0}+\lambda_t) - W(\pi_{t_0},\sigma_{t_0}+\lambda_{t_0}) \\
&= \sum_j\pi_{j,t_0} \left( \Big(\sigma_{j,t_0}+\lambda_{j,t}\Big)^2 - \Big(\sigma_{j,t_0}+\lambda_{j,t_0}\Big)^2 \right) \\[10pt] 

\delta_C^{D,t}
&= \Big( B(\pi_t,\mu_{t_0}+\beta_t) - B(\pi_{t_0},\mu_{t_0}+\beta_t ) \Big) - \Big( B(\pi_t,\mu_t ) - B(\pi_{t_0},\mu_t ) \Big) + \Big( W(\pi_t,\sigma_{t_0}+\lambda_t ) - W(\pi_{t_0},\sigma_{t_0}+\lambda_t ) \Big) - \Big( W(\pi_t,\sigma_t ) - W(\pi_{t_0},\sigma_t ) \Big) \\
&\approx \sum_j(\pi_{j,t}-\pi_{j,t_0} ) \left( \Big(\mu_{j,t_0}+\beta_{j,t}-\sum_j\pi_{j,t}(\mu_{j,t_0}+\beta_{j,t})\Big)^2 - \Big(\mu_{j,t}-\sum_j\pi_{j,t}\mu_{j,t}\Big)^2 + \Big(\sigma_{j,t_0}+\lambda_{j,t}\Big)^2-\sigma_{j,t}^2 \right) \\[10pt]

\delta_P^{D,t}
&= B(\pi_t,\mu_t+\beta_t) - B(\pi_t,\mu_{t_0}+\beta_t) + W(\pi_t,\sigma_t+\lambda_t) - W(\pi_t,\sigma_{t_0}+\lambda_t) - \Big( B(\pi_{t_0},\mu_t) - B(\pi_{t_0},\mu_{t_0}) + W(\pi_{t_0},\sigma_t) - W(\pi_{t_0},\sigma_{t_0}) \Big) \\
&= \sum_j\pi_{j,t} \left( \Big(\mu_{j,t}+\beta_{j,t}-\sum_j\pi_{j,t}(\mu_{j,t}+\beta_{j,t}) \Big)^2 - \Big(\mu_{j,t_0}+\beta_{j,t}-\sum_j\pi_{j,t}(\mu_{j,t_0}+\beta_{j,t})\Big)^2 + \Big(\sigma_{j,t}+\lambda_{j,t} \Big)^2 - \Big(\sigma_{j,t_0}+\lambda_{j,t}\Big)^2 \right) - \sum_j\pi_{j,t_0} \left( \Big(\mu_{j,t}-\sum_j\pi_{j,t_0}\mu_{j,t}\Big)^2 - \Big(\mu_{j,t_0}-\sum_j\pi_{j,t_0}\mu_{j,t_0}\Big)^2 + \sigma_{j,t}^2-\sigma_{j,t_0}^2 \right)

\end{split}
\tag{6}
\end{equation}

#### 2c Decomposing the change in the post-treatment variance due to treatment

Rather than decomposing the change in the effect of treatment on the variance, the change in post-treatment variance induced by the change in the effect of treatment, i.e., $V[Y_t(1)|D_t] - V[Y_(t_0 )(1)|D_(t_0 )]$, can also be decomposed. 

\begin{equation}
V[Y_t(1)|D_t] - V[Y_(t_0 )(1)|D_(t_0 )]
= \delta_B^{D,t} + \delta_W^{D,t} + \delta_C^{D,t} + \delta_P^{D,t} \\[10pt]
\text{where} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}

\delta_B^{D,t}
&=\sum_j\pi_{jt_0} \left( \Big(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt_0}(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt})\Big)^2 - \Big(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt_0}-\sum_j\pi_{jt_0}(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt_0})\Big)^2 \right) \\[10pt]

\delta_W^{D,t}
&= \sum_j\pi_{jt_0}\left( \Big(\sigma_{jt_0}+\lambda_{jt}\Big)^2 - \Big(\sigma_{jt_0}+\lambda_{jt_0}\Big)^2 \right) 
= \sum_j\pi_{jt_0} \Big( \lambda_{jt}^2-\lambda_{jt_0}^2 + 2\sigma_{jt_0}(\lambda_{jt}-\lambda_{jt_0}) \Big) \\[10pt]

\delta_C^{D,t}
&= \sum_j\pi_{jt}\left( \Big(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt}(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt})\Big)^2 + \Big(\sigma_{jt_0}+\lambda{jt}\Big)^2 \right) - \sum_j\pi_{jt_0}\left( \Big(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt_0} (\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt})\Big)^2 + \Big(\sigma_{jt_0}+\lambda_{jt}\Big)^2 \right) \\
&\approx \sum_j(\pi_{jt}-\pi_{jt_0}) \left( \Big(\mu_{jt}+\beta_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt}(\mu_{jt}+\beta_{jt})\Big)^2 + \Big(\sigma_{jt_0}+\lambda_{jt} \Big)^2 \right) \\[10pt] 

\delta_P^{D,t}
&=\sum_j\pi_{jt} \left( \Big(\mu_{jt}+\beta_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt}(\mu_{jt}+\beta_{jt})\Big)^2 - \Big(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt}-\sum_j\pi_{jt}(\mu_{jt_0}+\beta_{jt})\Big)^2 + \Big(\sigma_{jt}+\lambda_{jt}\Big)^2 - \Big(\sigma_{jt_0}+\lambda_{jt}\Big)^2 \right)

\end{split}
\tag{7}
\end{equation}
